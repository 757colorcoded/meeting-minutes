### What worked

Getting people to speak worked with a great turnout in initial meeting.  Keep the consistency with building a great community.  Sense of trust with how much we've grown since the initial meetup.  Fundamental topics helped gain interest.


### What didn't work

The group was increasing but not represented in people attending.  Hacktoberfest could've/should've been facilitated better to engage the commmunity for contributions.  Customer feedback would help with engaging members to contribute.Use email for survey, maybe meetup.com.  Integrate users in the group with tasks to achieve ownership.  Slack channel logistics.  _(Not everyone who is a leadedr can post in announcements, etc)_ Leverage Code4HR to help build community.
